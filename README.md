Life tips and skills
1. In doing anything, it is better to have only a glimpse of the result of that work. In other words, it is better not to provide the energy required for that work from the final result of that work.
2. If we constantly check the expected end result while doing things, the progress of that activity may not be very favorable. Therefore, it is better to make decisions based on the final result and in the implementation, do based on the interests of that work.

4. Exaggeration in speaking against a problem does not necessarily mean solving that problem or finding its solution.
5. The solution to some problems is to deny those problems.
6. Thinking that there is a problem, is part of the problem. Because if that problem is solved, that perception must also be corrected.
7. The use of negative or positive expressions to express what is in our mind, indicates the direction of movement that we choose. For example, if our goal is to improve things, we can say: things are not going very well. Or if we say: surpass each other in good deeds, it may mean taking advantage of the listeners. Instead, we can say: Don't compete in bad things.
8. If we try to pursue all of our interests at once, we may lose focus on interests of far greater importance.
9. The tendency to solve the root of all problems may cause us to ignore gradual solutions to some problems that may be possible in some cases.
10. If your enemy has a winning blade, a shield is a better option for you than a more winning blade.
11. The ability to create opportunities and the ability to use opportunities do not necessarily come together in the same person.
12. If we want to prevent excessive fatigue in our life, we can plan in a way to achieve results by not doing certain things and refraining from certain thoughts.
13. If we always express the facts without any special purpose, random purposes will be conceivable for it, which are not necessarily according to our desire.
14. When advising others, instead of commanding and forbidding them, put concepts and mechanisms in their minds, so that they can make the right decision in different situations, because the conditions that they will probably deal with will not be exactly the conditions that you have considered at that time.
15. In most cases, those who have experience do not generously share it with anyone and express their experiences in such a way that we feel compelled to do so in order to pursue their own interests along with it.
16. When we teach something to someone benevolently and without getting paid, let's not forget that he may eventually find enough independence and even ignore us. Therefore, it is better not to seek benefits in this way, because the beneficial effects of the advice we have given may decrease.
Philosophical notes without proof
1. The harmony between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind is something that exists in its best form in animals, and if it occurs in humans as well, it will probably bring great improvements. This means that just as the subconscious mind of a person is naturally affected by his thoughts, the conscious thoughts of a person should consider the requirements of the subconscious mind and plan it more intelligently. In fact, this impression is better to be two-way.
2. Any type of social tendency increases in the fantasy world, it will decrease in the real world. For example, fantasy morality, fantasy masochism and sadism. In fact, experiencing a task in a fantasy world is like simulating it, with the goal of making less mistakes in real life. But it is not always good, for example, human morality may require practical action.
3. Knowing everything does not mean superiority, but it is important to choose correctly what is worth knowing. Knowing is nothing but stepping on a path.
4. Accurate and mathematical treatment of human problems has probably been the biggest cause of human misery throughout history. The question is, when we can easily find reasons for any tendency we have in mind, what is the need to resort to precise philosophical and legal foundations?
5. Talking about other people's faults does not bring us an advantage because if we are better than them, we should also succeed in convincing them.
